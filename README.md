# Packet Sniffer using Python
A modular and extensible Packet Sniffer built in Python using Scapy, capable of capturing and analyzing network traffic in real-time. This project demonstrates how to work with raw packets, extract useful metadata (like source/destination IP, ports, protocols), and log the information to the console and a file.


🚀 Features
🧠 Modular Codebase: Clean and maintainable code divided into multiple scripts.

🌐 Protocol Detection: Supports TCP, UDP, ICMP, and more.

🖥️ Live Packet Logging: Real-time packet display on the terminal.

📝 Logging: Saves captured packets to captured_packets.log.

⚙️ Customizable: Easily extend to support more protocols or export formats.

🛠️ Requirements
1. Python 3.x

2. Admin/root privileges to capture packets

3. scapy library
